In this project (Udagram App), I deployed web servers for a highly available web app using CloudFormation. The script is divided into eight files for maintenance purpose. I wrote the script that creates and deploys the infrastructure and application for an HighAvailable-WebApp from the ground up. The script begin deploying the networking components followed by servers, security roles and software.



* create.sh : Cloudformation create stack script. 
* update.sh : Cloudformation update stack script.
* destroy.sh : Cloudformation delete stack script.
* bucket-stack.yml : s3 Bucket's CloudFormation yml script.
* bucket-params.json : Project's CloudFormation parameters script.
